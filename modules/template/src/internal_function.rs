// an "impl<T: Trait> Module<T>" block. An internal function can access the storage and the
// functions (dispatchable, internal or pure) of this or any other module. However, they
// can't be called by pure functions.

        // Call a pure function.
        let number = pure_function();

        // Store value.
        <Self as Store>::SomeValue::put(number);

        // Return Ok.
